# Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.

z = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # enter the number

x = int(input("Enter the divisor: "))  # enter the divisor

remainder = x % z  # find the remainder

print(f"The remainder when {z} is divided by {x} is: {remainder}")  # print the remainder
